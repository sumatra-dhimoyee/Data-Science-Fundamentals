There is no specific number at which we can start doubting the integrity of the coin. Every flip has a 0.5 chance of producing heads, and each flip stands independent from the others. With a fair coin, the probability of receiving ten heads in a row is (0.5)^10, 0.0009765625, or around 0.1%. Even though the likelihood is minimal, it is not impossible. A sample size of ten flips is not substantial. Even though ten heads in a row may appear unlikely, it is not statistically significant. A larger sample size would be required to make intelligible judgments regarding the fairness of the coin. We could toss a coin in several sets, each with a higher number of flips. Bias could be present if there is aÂ significant deviation from the anticipated 50/50 heads-to-tail ratio over several trials.
